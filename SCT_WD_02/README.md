A simple, elegant, and interactive **Stopwatch Web Application** project which demonstrates timer logic, event handling, and UI/UX polish — including dynamic two-color gradient backgrounds that change based on user actions (Start, Pause/Resume, Reset, Lap).

- Lap recording list with labeled lap numbers  
- Dynamic two-tone gradient backgrounds that change when interacting with controls:
  - Start → green gradient  
  - Pause/Resume → yellow gradient  
  - Reset → orange gradient  
  - Laps → sequence of colorful gradients (purple, pink, red, yellow, sea-blue, turquoise, deep-red, golden, black/grey, etc.)
- Responsive, curved (oval) UI container for a friendly aesthetic  
- Clean, explainable JavaScript logic (easy to present in demos)
