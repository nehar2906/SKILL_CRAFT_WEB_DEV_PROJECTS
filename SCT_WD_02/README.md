## 🔖 Project Overview
A simple, elegant, and interactive **Stopwatch Web Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, timer logic, event handling, and UI/UX polish — including dynamic two-color gradient backgrounds that change based on user actions (Start, Pause/Resume, Reset, Lap). The stopwatch also records lap times (up to many laps) and displays milliseconds for higher precision.
